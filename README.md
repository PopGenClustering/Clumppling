# Local Version
The local version requires downloading and installing the program to your local machine. 

## How to Install

### 1. Open a **command line interpreter** (i.e., a shell)
   * Linux and macOS users can use the built-in Terminal. 
   * For Windows users, you will need to obtain a terminal. For example: 
     - After you follow Step 3 to install Conda, you can use the built-in *Anaconda Prompt* available from the Anaconda Navigator. Note that the installation of Python and Conda on Windows only requires running the installers and there is no need for running commands in the command window.
     - You may also use the built-in (for Windows 10) [*Windows PowerShell*](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/powershell). 
     - Or, you can use *Git Bash* after you install Git by downloading and running the executable Git installer from https://git-scm.com/download/win.

### 2. Install **Python** (Version 3.8 and above recommended)
   You can download the Python installer from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
   * For **Windows** users, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ to download the installer corresponding to your operating system, e.g., Windows installer (64-bit). Run the executable installer and check the box 'Add Python to environment variables' during the installation.
   * For **macOS** users, go to https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/ to download the macOS 64-bit universal2 installer and double-click on the *python-<version>-macosx.pkg* file to start the Python installer.
   * For **Linux** users, if Python is not pre-installed, you can install it via command lines (``sudo yum install -y python3`` for CentOS and Red Hat Linux and ``sudo apt-get install python3`` for all other Linux systems). 
   
   You can verify the installation by running 
   ````
   python --version
   ```` 
   in the command line interpreter, which should give you the version of the installed Python.

### 3. Install conda and create a virtual environment 
   Go to https://www.anaconda.com/download to download the conda installer and run the installer. Conda is a popular package management system and environment management system.
   
   > A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the Python interpreter, libraries and scripts installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system"
   
   Using a virtual environment helps to keep the dependencies required by different projects separate and to avoid conflicts between projects. 
   
   Create a virtual environment named ``clumppling-env`` by typing the following command in the command-line interpreter
   ````
   conda create -n clumppling-env python
   ````
   Activate the virtual environment by
   ````
   conda activate clumppling-env 
   ````
### 4. Install the *Clumppling* package 
   **(1) Install the package**  

   Usually, pip is automatically installed when you installed Python. If it is not yet available in the system, follow the instructions from [https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install it.
   
   Then run the following command to install the package:
   ````
   pip install clumppling
   ````
   
   > **Alternatively**, you may choose to install the package in one of the two other ways: 
   >
   > If you have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed, run ```pip install git+https://github.com/PopGenClustering/Clumppling```.
   > 
   > If you don't have Git, run ```pip install https://github.com/PopGenClustering/Clumppling/archive/master.zip```.

   **(2) Download the example files from [the input directory](input) in the GitHub repository** \
   For each example dataset, unzip the files into a folder with the same name as the zip file, and put it inside a folder called "input" under a path of your choice. 
   
   For example, you may put it inside a path ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling``. Then the path for all the example files should be ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling/input``. The path for the Cape Verde example data should be ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling/input/capeverde``.
   
   More will be discussed in the section *How to Run (with an example)*.
      
### 5. Check whether the installation is successful
   Run the following command:
   ````
   python -m clumppling -h
   ````
   If the installation was successful, you should see the usage of the program in the command window. The usage tells you the required and optional arguments to the program. It should look like:
   ````
    usage: __main__.py [-h] -i INPUT_PATH -o OUTPUT_PATH -f INPUT_FORMAT [-v VIS] [--cd_param CD_PARAM]
                       [--use_rep USE_REP] [--merge_cls MERGE_CLS] [--cd_default CD_DEFAULT] [--plot_modes PLOT_MODES]

## Input Arguments
The main module takes in three required arguments and several optional ones. The required arguments are
* ``-i`` (``--input_path``) path to load input files
* ``-o`` (``--output_path``) path to save output files
* ``-f`` (``--input_format``) input data format. This choice must be one of "structure", "admixture", "fastStructure", and "generalQ".

The optional arguments are ``cd_param``, ``use_rep``, ``merge_cls``, ``cd_default``, ``plot_modes``, ``plot_modes_withinK``, ``plot_major_modes``, ``plot_all_modes``, and ``custom_cmap``. **Detailed explanation of these arguments can be found in the [Manual](Clumppling_Manual.pdf).**

    
## How to Run (with an example)
As a quick start, let's use the [Cape Verde data](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2017.07.002) as an example. The data files are available in the zip file [input/capeverde.zip](input/capeverde.zip). 

1. **Ensure that the data files have been successfully downloaded and put under the right directory.** Following Step 4(2) from above, you should have already downloaded the zip file "capeverde.zip" and extracted the data files inside the zip file to a folder named "capeverde" under a directory called "input" that you created. \
For example, the data files are extracted to ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling/input/capeverde``.

2. **Ensure that the current path is the parent directory of the "input" folder.** In your command-line interpreter, make sure that you navigate to the directory where the folder "input" is located. For the Cape Verde example, you should be in the directory ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling``. 
   
   If you do not know your current path, you can run ``pwd`` to see it in the command window. 
   
   The Cape Verde data files should be located in ``input/capeverde`` under your current path. I.e., When you run
   ````ls input/capeverde````
   you should see a list of Cape Verde data files *(CAPEVERDE_Rep1.2.indivq, CAPEVERDE_Rep1.3.indivq, etc.)*

4. **Run the program** under the default setting
   ````
   python -m clumppling -i input/capeverde -o output/capeverde -f admixture 
   ````
   The outputs will be saved in ``output/capeverde`` under your current directory and a zipped file of the same name will also be generated. For example, if you are in the directory ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling``, then the input will be saved in ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling/output/capeverde`` and zipped in ``C:/Users/YOUR_USER_NAME/Clumppling/output/capeverde.zip``.
   
   ***Notes:***
   * If your data files are in a directory different from the given example, make sure to specify the corresponding input path after ``-i``.
   * You can also change the parameters from those in the default setting. Here is another example for the chicken example (data available in the zip file [input/chicken.zip](input/chicken.zip)), where we specify the parameters ``cd_param`` and ``custom_cmap``:
      ````
      python -m clumppling -i input/chicken -o output/chicken_color -f structure --cd_param 1.05 --custom_cmap #D65859,#00AAC1,#01C0F6,#FDF0C4,#F1B38C,#AAD6BD,#6BB582,#B5DDF7,#AE8557,#FCEC73,#A4A569,#4264AC,#A1CDB2,#DE9D5D,#D9439A,#ABB2BA,#8775B3,#B3865C,#DADDE6,#E7BDD1,#FF9999
      ````
      Here we are setting the community detection parameter ``cd_param`` to be 1.05. This parameter controls the resolution, i.e., the size of the detected communities, of the Louvain algorithm used for community detection. The default value is 1.0, and a larger value will result in smaller communities and more of them, thus detecting more modes. Please see Section 4.3 of the paper. If the default parameter value is giving undesirable mode detection results, for instance, assigning each replicate to its own mode or assigning obviously different replicates to a single mode, you may vary this parameter to get a desired size and number of the modes. We suggest increasing or decreasing the parameter incrementally by 0.05 to search for a good choice of value for your dataset. \
      We are also providing a custom colormap (``custom_cmap``) for visualization of the alignment results. The clusters will be colored based on colors specified by the list of comma-separated HEX codes.

   * More example commands to call the program can be found under [the scripts directory](scripts) in the GitHub repository.
